'''Pine Village''' is a town in [[Adams Township, Warren County, Indiana|Adams Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The population was 255 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Pine Village is located at the intersection of [[Indiana State Road 55|State Road 55]] and [[Indiana State Road 26|State Road 26]], near [[Big Pine Creek (Indiana)|Big Pine Creek]].{{GR|1}}  It is about {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] and about {{convert|14|mi}} east of the [[Illinois]] border.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.126|sqmi}}, all of it land.

==History==
The town was founded at the location of a trading post called Pine Village, which may have been named for a lone pine tree that stood on the bluff of Pine Creek, or it may have been named for the creek itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town was laid out in 1851 by Isaac and John R. Metsker, and the plat map was made by county surveyor Perrin Kent.  The Methodist Church was already there; it was built several years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Rail service===
Rail service reached the town in the 1870s.  The year 1883 witnessed the completion of a north/south [[Chicago and Great Southern Railway]] (later the [[Chicago and Indiana Coal Railway]]) line between [[Attica, Indiana|Attica]] and [[Fair Oaks, Indiana|Fair Oaks]], which subsequently came under the ownership of the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]].  The line came to be known as the &quot;Coal Road&quot; for the large quantities of [[coal]] transported along it.  When the C&amp;EI floundered in the early 1920s, Charles F. Propst purchased the Coal Road and in October 1922 incorporated it as the [[Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad]].  The CA&amp;S was placed in [[receivership]] on August 5, 1931, and incremental abandonment occurred over subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The area on the east side of Pine Village near the railroad, consisting of a grain elevator and some homes, was known as Oklahoma&lt;ref name=&quot;awapv&quot; /&gt; and is located at {{coord|40|26|59|N|87|14|42|W|type:landmark_region:US-IN|name=Oklahoma}}.

===Football===
From a historical marker entitled &quot;Pine Village Football&quot;, located near the town fire station: &lt;blockquote&gt;Local team was important Indiana precursor to modern professional [[American football|football]] organizations.  Clinton Beckett introduced football to Pine Village High School 1898. Town and high school teams played on bottomland, northwest of here, starting local football tradition. Town team, the Villagers, managed by C.J. Shackleton and later by Claire Rhode. Team became &quot;professional&quot; 1915, claiming state and regional championships. Jim Thorpe, All-American, played for Villagers in 1915 Thanksgiving Day game against [[Purdue University|Purdue]] All-Stars: Villagers won 29 to 0. Team was a founder of Indiana Football League 1917. Following World War I, the Villagers played intermittently until 1927.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''State Line City''' is a town in [[Kent Township, Warren County, Indiana|Kent Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]], located along the state's border with [[Illinois]].  As of the [[United States Census Bureau|2000 census]], the town population was 141.  The small section of town that protrudes west across the border is formally known as [[Illiana, Illinois]].

==History==
[[Image:State Line Lincoln marker.png|thumb|left|150px|A marker commemorates [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s speech.]]
In the mid-1850s, two large railway lines converged on the Indiana-Illinois state line – the narrow-gauge [[Wabash Valley Railroad]], whose route from the east crossed Warren County and reached the border in October 1856, and the standard-gauge [[Great Western Railroad (Illinois)|Great Western Railroad]], which shortly thereafter reached the state line from the west.  State Line City was platted on June 29, 1857 by Robert Casement at the convergence of these two railroads.  The city flourished, and within 10 years had reached a population of approximately 550, but because of the drinking and carousing of the numerous railroaders it gained an unsavory reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;hwc&quot;&gt;{{cite book

On February 11, 1861, [[Abraham Lincoln]] stopped in State Line on his way from [[Springfield, Illinois]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] for his inauguration.  He dined at the Frazier Eating House, then gave a short speech to a crowd in the public square before resuming his journey.  A historical marker on the site commemorates the event.

[[Image:State Line City Indiana map from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|150px|Map from 1877 atlas]]
The town's post office was established in July 1857, with Robert Casement as the first postmaster, and continues to operate today from a newer building on Woodard Street.  Grain elevators were erected in the fall of 1857, but fires in September 1900, December 1932 and June 1984 each completely destroyed the structures, which were subsequently rebuilt.  State Line's grain elevators are currently operated by [[Archer Daniels Midland]] of [[Decatur, Illinois]], and see considerable activity during harvest time.  The town's other large business is a fertilizer and agricultural sales facility northeast of town, built in 1975 and currently operated by Westland Co-Op. 

[[Image:State Line Palmer House.png|thumb|left|150px|The Palmer House, originally an [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] hall.]]
Other establishments in State Line include the Kent Township Fire Department, formed in 1978, which took over local fire protection responsibilities from the West Lebanon Fire Department; in 2000, however, the department merged back with West Lebanon, which now maintains the State Line fire station.  The KTFD sponsored for a number of years an annual town festival called the State Line Fun Days, but this is no longer held.  

As of 2007, State Line houses one active church: the State Line Christian Church, built in 1868.  Rev. Gerald Burt has been the pastor there since 1972.  The Church of the Nazarene (built around 1860 as a Presbyterian church and purchased for use as a Nazarene church in 1929) and the Methodist Church (built in 1863-4) were both disbanded due to low attendance in the 1990s and have since been turned into homes.  Rev. Jim Kessler was the last pastor at the Nazarene church.

==Geography==
State Line City is located in the southwestern part of the county in open farm land along the border with Illinois, five miles northeast of the city of [[Danville, Illinois|Danville]].  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.135|sqmi}}, all of it land.

The [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] runs southwest through town.  For many years the famous [[Wabash Cannonball]] ran on the line (then owned by the Wabash Railway), passing through town twice a day on its route from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] and back.  The Wabash Railway merged in the mid 1960s with the Norfolk and Western Railway, which in turn merged with Southern Railway in the 1980s to become Norfolk Southern, officially bringing an end to the Wabash name.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 141 people, 54 households, and 36 families residing in the town. The [[population density]] was 1,046.9 people per square mile (418.8/km²). There were 56 housing units at an average density of 415.8/sq&amp;nbsp;mi (166.3/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 98.58% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.71% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.71% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]]. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.42% of the population.

There were 54 households out of which 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 1.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.5% were non-families. 27.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.27.

In the town the population was spread out with 28.4% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 32.6% from 25 to 44, 24.1% from 45 to 64, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 120.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $34,250, and the median income for a family was $41,607. Males had a median income of $30,625 versus $14,000 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $15,685. There were none of the families and 3.7% of the population living below the [[poverty line]], including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

'''West Lebanon''' is a town in [[Pike Township, Warren County, Indiana|Pike Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The population was 793 at the 2000 census.

==History==
[[Image:West Lebanon, Indiana map from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|155px|Map from 1877 atlas]]
West Lebanon was laid out and [[plat]]ted in the fall of 1830 by Ebenezer Purviance, John G. Jemison and Andrew Fleming, and consisted of 64 lots.  Originally named Lebanon, the name was changed to West Lebanon in 1869 when the town was incorporated, possibly in deference to [[Lebanon, Indiana|the Boone County community of the same name]] which established its post office on December 15, 1832, just eleven days before their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not being close to any waterways, West Lebanon's early growth was relatively slow and for many years had no more than 20 families.  However, with the completion of the [[Wabash Railroad]] line one mile north of town in 1856, the community's fortunes improved and led to most of the town relocating closer to the station.  The original settlement area became known as Old Town.

'''Williamsport''' is a town in [[Washington Township, Warren County, Indiana|Washington Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The population was 1,935 at the 2000 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=Search&amp;geo_id=&amp;_geoContext=&amp;_street=&amp;_county=williamsport&amp;_cityTown=williamsport&amp;_state=04000US18&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;show_2003_tab=&amp;redirect=Y|title=Census 2000 data for Williamsport|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]].{{GR|6}}  It is home to [[Williamsport Falls]], the highest waterfall in the state.

==History==
Williamsport was [[plat]]ted by (and named for) William Harrison on December 11, 1828,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the south end of the eastern fractional part of the northeast quarter of section 11, township 21, range 8.  Harrison was the first to occupy the town in the fall of 1828, building a log house at the east end of Main Street near the river, and operated a ferry crossing there for several years.  Though located on the opposite side of the river from the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]], Williamsport sought to draw shipping traffic by constructing a short cut-off canal.  Finished around 1852, the project led to the nickname &quot;Side-Cut City&quot;.

Williamsport became the county seat in June 1829, taking the title away from short-lived [[Warrenton, Indiana|Warrenton]].  Its post office was the first in the county and has operated since September 28, 1829.  The town was incorporated in March 1854, at which time its population was 552.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[James Frank Hanly]], who was the Governor of Indiana from 1905 to 1909, lived and practiced law here from 1879 to 1896; he is buried at [[List of cemeteries in Warren County, Indiana#Hillside|Hillside Cemetery]], on the northeast side of town.

The [[Williamsport-Washington Township Public Library]] opened in 1917 as a [[Carnegie library]], and moved to a new facility in 2002.

===Historic Places===
The Williamsport [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church]] at 15 Fall Street, built in 1889, appears on the [[Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures]].  It was closed in 1964 and stood vacant until 1991, when a non-profit corporation was set up to support the restoration effort.  It was listed in 1998 after having received a new slate roof and other repairs.  The building contains the original stained glass windows, bell, pulpit, and pews.

The &quot;Tower House&quot; can be found at 303 Lincoln Street and was constructed in 1845.  The house was nicknamed due to its 3 story tower on the northeast corner of the building.  The house was originally constructed as a mirrored twin; the twin house was destroyed by a fire in the 1990s.  The house has changed from its original construction.  An enclosed front porch and side porch has been retooled to serve as the current family's kitchen area.  The house originally contained two large rooms upstairs, and three rooms downstairs.  What appears to be the summer kitchen and original carriage house still stand.  The house now has five bedrooms, one bath upstairs and seven rooms, an enclosed porch, and a bath downstairs.

The [[Warren County Courthouse (Indiana)|Warren County Courthouse]] at 125 North Monroe Street was built in 1907-1908 and is on the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]].  It is the fourth purpose-built court house in the county's history.

==Geography==
Williamsport is located along [[Indiana State Road 28|State Road 28]] near the shores of the [[Wabash River]] which forms the eastern border of the county.  Its most striking natural feature is [[Williamsport Falls]], a 90-foot [[waterfall]] near the center of town and Indiana's tallest.  Williamsport's original section (&quot;Old Town&quot;) is in bottom land next to the river; &quot;New Town&quot; was built on the hill above it to be closer to the railroad.  The rail line through town is currently operated by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|1.05|sqmi}}, all of it land.

==History==
From 1100 to 1450 AD, a community of several thousand mound-building [[Angel Mounds|Mississippian culture people]] lived in the Newburgh area. No one knows why they left. John Sprinkle, a businessman of German descent, landed here in the spring of 1803, thirteen years before [[Indiana]] entered the Union as the 19th state. The community he founded became known as Sprinklesburg, and it was the first town in Warrick County. In 1837, the name of the town was changed to Newburgh. By 1850, Newburgh had grown to be one of the largest riverports on the Ohio-Mississippi River between [[Cincinnati]] and [[New Orleans]].

{{main article|Newburgh Raid}}
On July 18, 1862, Newburgh was the first town north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to be captured by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces during the [[American Civil War]]. Colonel [[Adam Johnson (colonel)|Adam R. Johnson]], with a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] band, crossed the Ohio River and confiscated supplies and ammunition without a shot being fired. The Confederates would have been unable to shell the city (as promised) had Newburgh put up a fight. The Confederates' &quot;cannons&quot; were an assemblage of stove pipe, a charred log, and wagon wheels.

Newburgh grew steadily during the second half of the 20th Century with the increase of industry in the Evansville Metropolitan Area. Major area employers include Alcoa, Toyota Motors, Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals, Atlas Van Lines, the University of Evansville, and the University of Southern Indiana. Today, Newburgh boasts a lively historic district along with [[Castle High School (Indiana)|Castle High School]] that competes in statewide competitions in both athletics and academics.

On November 6, 2005, the [[Evansville Tornado of November 2005]] caused 25 deaths in nearby Evansville. Newburgh suffered extensive property damage and some injuries, but fortunately suffered no fatalities during the 2:06 AM tornado strike.

Each summer, Newburgh also hosts a number of festivals including the Fiddler Fest and the Strawberry Festival. Most are held on the shore of the river near to the town's lock and dam in the &quot;antique&quot; section of Newburgh.

In 2006, the [[United States Senior Men's Amateur Golf Championship]] was hosted in Newburgh at the [[Victoria National Golf Course]].

== History ==
The land for the town of New Pekin was first entered on August 25, 1818. The original town [[plat]] was made on December 23, 1883 by W. A. Graves. The town of New Pekin was incorporated in 1903 to provide funds to build and operate a school.

=== &quot;Old&quot; Pekin ===
On September 29, 1819, Isaac Davis entered section 30 in what was to become Polk Township. Several years later in 1831 Christian Bixler laid out the town of Pekin on the south side of [[Mutton Fork, Blue River]].

Before 1831, there were several buildings at this location. As early as 1830 stage coaches were making regular runs between [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] and [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]]. A wagon route between [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]] also passed through this area. Pekin was a staging stop where horses were watered and changed.

The town prospered until 1851 when the railroad was completed. The train station was built on the more level north side of Blue River. Businesses gradually migrated to the new location. In 1854 the County Commissioners declared the town vacant and the area became known as Old Pekin.

=== Fourth of July Celebration ===
The town of New Pekin claims the distinction of having the oldest consecutive [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] celebration in the [[United States of America]]. Pekin began celebrating [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] in the year 1830. [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] claims to have celebrated since 1785.

Not too many historical facts about the earliest celebrations exist. The information available comes from oral tradition. The first several celebrations were said to be neighborhood affairs. It is assumed that it did not stay that way for long. Many families lived in the surrounding townships and there were not many social activities.

Various sources recount that the celebration was held near Old Pekin from 1830 until 1856. Around 1857 the celebration was moved to near the Blue River where festivities were held until 1885. In either 1872 or 1873 the picnic was held at the farm of James Campbell where he had built a recreational area.

The fall of 1884 saw the completion of the fairgrounds. The following year (1885), the celebration was moved to the new fairgrounds. Many local residents did not agree with the celebration being moved there and held a second celebration at Tash Grove.

In 1909, the Gill brothers bought the southern part of the old fairgrounds. It became known as Gill's Grove. This became the present location of the Pekin Community Park, where the celebration has been held every year since.

Today the celebration consists of a [[Fireworks|fireworks display]] a [[parade]], live bands, 3 on 3 [[basketball]] tournament, [[carnival]], food vendors, a [[flea market]], reading of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], prince &amp; princess [[competition|contest]], [[Horseshoes|Horseshoe Pitching Contest]], a queen contest, cookouts and many other small celebrations around the town of Pekin.

=== Morgan's Raid ===
On July 11, 1863, while crossing Blue River near New Pekin, Captain William J. Davis of [[Morgan's Raid]] and some of his men were captured by 73rd [[Indiana]] Volunteers and a detachment of the 5th U.S. Regulars. Captain Davis and several other soldiers were taken to [[New Albany, Indiana]] and secured in the county jail.

==History==
=== Morgan's Raid ===
In June 1863, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[cavalry]] under [[John Hunt Morgan]] had departed [[Tennessee]] on what would later became known as [[Morgan's Raid]]. Traveling through Tennessee and into Kentucky, Morgan eventually crossed into Indiana; he reached Salem on July 10, 1863, coming north from [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]]. Upon entering Salem at approximately 9 a.m., Morgan immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets. The cavalrymen burned the large, brick railroad depot, along with all the train cars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of the town. Morgan demanded taxes from the two [[flour mill]]s that belonged to DePauw and Knight, and from the Allen Wollen Mill. Morgan's men looted stores and took about $500 from the area before departing about 3 p.m.

Of the brief action at Salem, [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Basil W. Duke]], Morgan's second-in-command and brother-in-law, later said:

''&quot;They did not pillage with any sort of method or reason; it seemed to be a mania, senseless and purposeless. One man carried for two days a bird cage containing three [[canary|canaries]]. Another rode with a huge chafing dish on the pommel of his saddle. Although the weather was intensely warm, another slung seven pairs of [[skates]] around his neck. I saw very few articles of real value taken; they pillaged like boys robbing an [[orchard]].&quot;''

===Famous residents===
[[John Hay]], private secretary to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to Presidents [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was born in Salem and is generally known as Salem's most prominent citizen. A variety of museums and local buildings make reference to Mr. Hay's connections to the town.

Roy Robertson invented the process for making 2% [[milk]] while working at the Salem Creamery, where it was first produced and marketed. He was unable to obtain a patent and the invention was credited to someone else.

==Local Attractions==
Located in the center of Salem's town square, the Washington County Courthouse is generally known as Salem's most famous and recognizable landmark. The courthouse has historical placemarkers surrounding it, and at the southeastern corner of the grounds, there is a memorial to veterans killed in action during conflicts dating back to the [[Revolutionary War]].

Unusual for a town of this size is a large children's playground, &quot;Riley's Place&quot; at DePauw Park. Named after Riley Jean Tomlinson, a local toddler who accidentally drowned in a swimming pool, the park was built in 2001 and contains two- and three- story wooden castles and other structures for children's play (along with swings, slides, and similar playground equipment).

Every September, Salem celebrates &quot;Old Settler's Day&quot; at the [[John Hay Center]]. Set in a village of authentic log structures, the festival features historical re-enactments, as well as local arts and crafts.

Recently, Lake Salinda in Salem has been rumored to be home to the Salinda Serpent after reports were made about sightings of a giant snake in the lake. This information was reported by the Salem Leader in early June 2010.

Salem is also home to the legendary Salem Speedway. It is a half mile high banked paved oval that was first built in 1947. Many of the most legendary drivers of the past 50 years have raced there including Ted Horn, Parnelli Jones, AJ Foyt, Bobby and Al Unser, Mario Andretti, Larry Dickson, Darrell Waltrip and Jeff Gordon. AJ Foyt at one time held the world record for a half mile oval at the speedway. One of ESPN's first televised auto racing events was held there in 1979.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 1.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (2.7&amp;nbsp;km²), all of it land.

== Notable Information ==
Cambridge City was platted on October 23, 1836 and celebrated its [[Sesquicentennial]] in 1986.  The town celebrates its history and heritage during the second weekend in each September during the annual Canal Days festival, which commemorates the importance of the [[Whitewater Canal]] to the formation and growth of Cambridge City in the 19th century.  Situated along the historic [[National Road]] (U.S. 40), Cambridge City is currently a prominent destination for antique seekers and is the home of many notable American figures including:

*'''Justin Youngs'''- Local meat cutter famous for throwing bologna &amp; an OG.  
*'''Buckskin Ben''' - a famous show business personality of the 1890s
*'''Jason Bunger''' - Was a manager of the girls Tennis team (1996-1999) for three teams (1997-1999) who went to Semi State, the most of any team in Lincoln High School sports history. He is also a founding owner of www.fvsports.com, one of the premier sports sites on the web. Jason was also one of the most dominant Wiffle Ball players in the State of Indiana.
*&quot;'''Single G'''&quot; - a world famous pacer who won many horse races during the Great Depression
*'''[[Solomon Meredith]]''' - a [[Quaker]] general in the [[American Civil War]]
*'''The [[Overbeck Sisters]]''' - four daughters of John and Sarah Overpeck who hand-produced their internationally-known Overbeck Art Pottery in Cambridge City from 1911–1955, noted for their [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] designs, distinctive glazes and work in the grotesque style
*'''Huddleston Farmhouse''' - The [[Huddleston Farmhouse]] Inn &amp; Museum is located right outside Cambridge City in the small village of [[Mt. Auburn]] on the National Road.  It is the eastern regional office of [[Indiana Landmarks]] and the headquarters of the Indiana National Road Association.  Cambridge City is noted for its abundance in historic architecture, specifically in the Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles.  Famous structures include Rose Hill, the Conklin-Montgomery House, the Overbeck-Mattheis House, the Meredith-Rice House, the Bertsch House (home of the town's resident physician James Bertsch, D.O.), the Scheilder/Biser House, the Demwiddle-Mattingly House, the Martin Funk-Johnson House, the Fowler House, and many more.
*'''Vinton House''' - The Vinton House of Cambridge City is a former hotel that was established in 1847. This building sits at the former intersection of the National Road (U.S 40) and the Whitewater Canal. The canal's turnaround basin rested just a few feet from the Vinton House's rear door, which brought in passengers and goods from Cincinnati.

During the 1990s, members of Cambridge City's historic preservation group Western Wayne Heritage, Inc. purchased the famous Vinton House hotel.  Built in the 1840s to accommodate travelers on the newly opened Whitewater Canal and the National Road, Aaron Reisor opened the three-story hostelry on the Canal bank to run what at the time was one of Indiana's most opulent facilities.  Founded in 1984, Western Wayne Heritage, Inc. has been instrumental in promoting the history and culture of the Cambridge City area during the recent antique-history tourist boom of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

The Montgomery-Whitewater Chapter of the Indiana Junior Historical Society is located in Cambridge City and is sponsored by Lori Griffin, who was named by Mark Helmsing of the Indiana Council for History Education as an outstanding sponsor.

==History==

Centerville was platted in 1814 on land that once belonged to the [[Miami Indians]] and was settled by [[Quakers]] from Carolina and [[Virginia]]. A little known &quot;[[war]]&quot; was fought in [[Wayne County, Indiana]] in 1873 between Centerville and [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]]. The county seat was originally located in Centerville (Center Township). By 1870, Richmond (Wayne Township) had surpassed Centerville in business, population, and tax revenue. These factors led the population of Wayne Township to demand the county seat be moved to Richmond. The dispute was played out in the newspapers, courts, and petitions with Richmond the eventual winner.
A new courthouse was erected in Richmond and preparations were made to move records from Centerville to Richmond. Centerville stopped Richmond’s officials’ efforts to move the records twice. Once with locked gates with guards and the second by firing on their own courthouse with a three-pound [[cannon]] nicknamed “Black Betty.” The cannon was used when Richmond guards were brought in to protect the records. The cannon had been loaded with iron scraps. A crowd demanded the guard come out of the Centerville courthouse. When they refused, the cannon was fired, the door blown off its hinges, and the guards were forced to beat a hasty retreat&lt;ref&gt;Spahr, W. E. (1966). &quot;Center Township Library, Centerville, Indiana&quot;.&gt;[ http://www.waynet.org/waynet/spotlight/2001/011126-war.htm] Retrieved July 18, 2010, from Waynet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Soldiers were brought in the next day to move the records to Richmond. Centerville’s tenure as county seat had come to an end.
 
The holes from the cannon shot are still visible over the door of the old courthouse, now the Center Township Library.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 1828, the National Road, Main Street, was surveyed and later became the first improved section of the trail in 1850 by a Special Act of the [[U.S. Congress]].

Centerville's [[cobblestone]] [[street]] was a major stop along the trail to the West. During the height of the [[Gold Rush]], 49,000 wagons would travel along the street each year.

Centerville is known as the “City of Arches” due to the five main [[arches]] it has located on the Old National Road. The road used to be 100 feet wide, but was shortened to 65 feet due to the people of Centerville adding on to the front of the businesses and houses. The arches were used as a way to get behind the buildings and into the backyards of the houses&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Centerville, Indiana: The city of arches&quot;. (2008, March 10). [http://pwda.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/PWDA.woa/wa/page?id=7609&amp;name=areaCENTERVILLE] Retrieved July 16, 2010, from The Lantz House and Gathering Place Inn. &lt;/ref&gt;. The five arches that are located in Centerville are the Backenstoes Archway, Dill Archway, Shortridge Archway, Lantz Archway, and Malone Archway. They were all built between 1823 and 1836&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Centerville, Indiana&quot; . (2010).[http://www.waynet.org/community/centerville/default.htm].Retrieved July 16, 2010, from Waynet: Community Network Association.&lt;/ref&gt;.They are all located on [[National Road]] in Centerville. In August, Centerville has Archway Days, which is held in celebration and honor of the historical archways. They have food, games, and prizes, which attracts people from all over the state.

==History==
Whitewater has the distinction of being &quot;incorporated&quot; which means, unlike other towns its size, that there actually is a town board, and although it is a very small community it still has street lights and sidewalks.  

The last business in Whitewater was Wolf's Union 76 gas station.  It consisted of a small garage and two gas pumps that were bordering Whitewater Road.  It closed in May 1992.

The general store is still standing though it has not been in business for many years.  It is at the corner of Whitewater Road and 227.  

The barber shop was auctioned off and razed in 1995; it had been abandoned for quite some time.

There is an old apartment building that has been empty for over 30 years and was used primarily for leather storage.  As of June 2007 the building is undergoing a renovation process.

A popular hangout for the children of Whitewater was the old iron bridge on Whitewater Road.  A sinkhole formed in the wood flooring of the bridge in the late 1990s, and it was blocked off for many months.  During this time vehicles bypassed the barricades and continued driving over the bridge.  Eventually permanent barricades were bolted to the bridge to prevent vehicles from crossing.  Many local farmers drove through the creek underneath the bridge during this time.  A new bridge was eventually put into place by 1998, and the road was drastically leveled on either side.  

Though not in the actual town of Whitewater, at the end of Whitewater Road an Amish Grocery store opened up in the late summer of 2006.  The area had not had a grocery store in many years and had to depend on the nearby town of Richmond for all shopping.  The store became very popular with the people of Whitewater, and nearby Fountain City and Bethel.  The store now carries a wide array of everyday items, and a complete deli.

Bluffton is one of the first towns in Indiana, and across [[United States|America]], to both publicly acknowledge its history of exclusion and to promote itself as an inclusive town.

The plank road was a toll road; any horse or horse-drawn vehicle had to pay a toll. The Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, &amp; Louisville Railroad was built through Ossian in 1869, though it was not in complete operation until the following year. Today, the railroad is a significant north-south route for the [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]]. Ossian is still served by [[Indiana State Road 1]], while four miles north is [[Interstate 469]], the beltway around [[Fort Wayne]], and also just seven miles south of [[Fort Wayne International Airport]].

==Economy==
Ossian has always been an industrial town. The businesses of yesterday have given way to modern establishments in recent decades. The town industrial park is home to engineering and manufacturing companies producing materials such as tool and die, plastic gas tanks, and import of bath fixtures, just to name a few. Ossian is also surrounded by agriculture, the most important piece of [[Indiana]]'s economy.

==School District==
Northern Wells Community Schools serves northern [[Wells County, Indiana|Wells County]], including the town of Ossian. The district operates four schools; Ossian Elementary, Lancaster Elementary, Norwell Middle School, and [[Norwell High School (Indiana)|Norwell High School]].It also operates a private school called '''Bethlehem Lutheran School''' which can be found on the east side of the town.
