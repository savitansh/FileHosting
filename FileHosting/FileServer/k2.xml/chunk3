==History==
Whitewater has the distinction of being &quot;incorporated&quot; which means, unlike other towns its size, that there actually is a town board, and although it is a very small community it still has street lights and sidewalks.  

The last business in Whitewater was Wolf's Union 76 gas station.  It consisted of a small garage and two gas pumps that were bordering Whitewater Road.  It closed in May 1992.

The general store is still standing though it has not been in business for many years.  It is at the corner of Whitewater Road and 227.  

The barber shop was auctioned off and razed in 1995; it had been abandoned for quite some time.

There is an old apartment building that has been empty for over 30 years and was used primarily for leather storage.  As of June 2007 the building is undergoing a renovation process.

A popular hangout for the children of Whitewater was the old iron bridge on Whitewater Road.  A sinkhole formed in the wood flooring of the bridge in the late 1990s, and it was blocked off for many months.  During this time vehicles bypassed the barricades and continued driving over the bridge.  Eventually permanent barricades were bolted to the bridge to prevent vehicles from crossing.  Many local farmers drove through the creek underneath the bridge during this time.  A new bridge was eventually put into place by 1998, and the road was drastically leveled on either side.  

Though not in the actual town of Whitewater, at the end of Whitewater Road an Amish Grocery store opened up in the late summer of 2006.  The area had not had a grocery store in many years and had to depend on the nearby town of Richmond for all shopping.  The store became very popular with the people of Whitewater, and nearby Fountain City and Bethel.  The store now carries a wide array of everyday items, and a complete deli.

The plank road was a toll road; any horse or horse-drawn vehicle had to pay a toll. The Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, &amp; Louisville Railroad was built through Ossian in 1869, though it was not in complete operation until the following year. Today, the railroad is a significant north-south route for the [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]]. Ossian is still served by [[Indiana State Road 1]], while four miles north is [[Interstate 469]], the beltway around [[Fort Wayne]], and also just seven miles south of [[Fort Wayne International Airport]].

The town industrial park is home to engineering and manufacturing companies producing materials such as tool and die, plastic gas tanks, and import of bath fixtures, just to name a few. Ossian is also surrounded by agriculture, the most important piece of [[Indiana]]'s economy.

==School District==
Northern Wells Community Schools serves northern [[Wells County, Indiana|Wells County]], including the town of Ossian. The district operates four schools; Ossian Elementary, Lancaster Elementary, Norwell Middle School, and [[Norwell High School (Indiana)|Norwell High School]].It also operates a private school called '''Bethlehem Lutheran School''' which can be found on the east side of the town.
