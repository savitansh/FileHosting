The [[per capita income]] for the town was $24,537. None of the families and 2.5% of the population were living below the [[poverty line]], including no under eighteens and 5.1% of those over 64.

==History==
From 1100 to 1450 AD, a community of several thousand mound-building [[Angel Mounds|Mississippian culture people]] lived in the Newburgh area. No one knows why they left. John Sprinkle, a businessman of German descent, landed here in the spring of 1803, thirteen years before [[Indiana]] entered the Union as the 19th state. The community he founded became known as Sprinklesburg, and it was the first town in Warrick County. In 1837, the name of the town was changed to Newburgh. By 1850, Newburgh had grown to be one of the largest riverports on the Ohio-Mississippi River between [[Cincinnati]] and [[New Orleans]].

{{main article|Newburgh Raid}}
On July 18, 1862, Newburgh was the first town north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to be captured by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces during the [[American Civil War]]. Colonel [[Adam Johnson (colonel)|Adam R. Johnson]], with a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] band, crossed the Ohio River and confiscated supplies and ammunition without a shot being fired. The Confederates would have been unable to shell the city (as promised) had Newburgh put up a fight. The Confederates' &quot;cannons&quot; were an assemblage of stove pipe, a charred log, and wagon wheels.

Newburgh grew steadily during the second half of the 20th Century with the increase of industry in the Evansville Metropolitan Area. Major area employers include Alcoa, Toyota Motors, Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals, Atlas Van Lines, the University of Evansville, and the University of Southern Indiana. Today, Newburgh boasts a lively historic district along with [[Castle High School (Indiana)|Castle High School]] that competes in statewide competitions in both athletics and academics.

On November 6, 2005, the [[Evansville Tornado of November 2005]] caused 25 deaths in nearby Evansville. Newburgh suffered extensive property damage and some injuries, but fortunately suffered no fatalities during the 2:06 AM tornado strike.

Each summer, Newburgh also hosts a number of festivals including the Fiddler Fest and the Strawberry Festival. Most are held on the shore of the river near to the town's lock and dam in the &quot;antique&quot; section of Newburgh.

In 2006, the [[United States Senior Men's Amateur Golf Championship]] was hosted in Newburgh at the [[Victoria National Golf Course]].

== History ==
The land for the town of New Pekin was first entered on August 25, 1818. The original town [[plat]] was made on December 23, 1883 by W. A. Graves. The town of New Pekin was incorporated in 1903 to provide funds to build and operate a school.

=== &quot;Old&quot; Pekin ===
On September 29, 1819, Isaac Davis entered section 30 in what was to become Polk Township. Several years later in 1831 Christian Bixler laid out the town of Pekin on the south side of [[Mutton Fork, Blue River]].

Before 1831, there were several buildings at this location. As early as 1830 stage coaches were making regular runs between [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] and [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]]. A wagon route between [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]] also passed through this area. Pekin was a staging stop where horses were watered and changed.

The town prospered until 1851 when the railroad was completed. The train station was built on the more level north side of Blue River. Businesses gradually migrated to the new location. In 1854 the County Commissioners declared the town vacant and the area became known as Old Pekin.

=== Fourth of July Celebration ===
The town of New Pekin claims the distinction of having the oldest consecutive [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] celebration in the [[United States of America]]. Pekin began celebrating [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] in the year 1830. [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] claims to have celebrated since 1785.

Not too many historical facts about the earliest celebrations exist. The information available comes from oral tradition. The first several celebrations were said to be neighborhood affairs. It is assumed that it did not stay that way for long. Many families lived in the surrounding townships and there were not many social activities.

Various sources recount that the celebration was held near Old Pekin from 1830 until 1856. Around 1857 the celebration was moved to near the Blue River where festivities were held until 1885. In either 1872 or 1873 the picnic was held at the farm of James Campbell where he had built a recreational area.

The fall of 1884 saw the completion of the fairgrounds. The following year (1885), the celebration was moved to the new fairgrounds. Many local residents did not agree with the celebration being moved there and held a second celebration at Tash Grove.

In 1909, the Gill brothers bought the southern part of the old fairgrounds. It became known as Gill's Grove. This became the present location of the Pekin Community Park, where the celebration has been held every year since.

Today the celebration consists of a [[Fireworks|fireworks display]] a [[parade]], live bands, 3 on 3 [[basketball]] tournament, [[carnival]], food vendors, a [[flea market]], reading of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], prince &amp; princess [[competition|contest]], [[Horseshoes|Horseshoe Pitching Contest]], a queen contest, cookouts and many other small celebrations around the town of Pekin.

=== Morgan's Raid ===
On July 11, 1863, while crossing Blue River near New Pekin, Captain William J. Davis of [[Morgan's Raid]] and some of his men were captured by 73rd [[Indiana]] Volunteers and a detachment of the 5th U.S. Regulars. Captain Davis and several other soldiers were taken to [[New Albany, Indiana]] and secured in the county jail.
