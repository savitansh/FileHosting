==History==
=== Morgan's Raid ===
In June 1863, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[cavalry]] under [[John Hunt Morgan]] had departed [[Tennessee]] on what would later became known as [[Morgan's Raid]]. Traveling through Tennessee and into Kentucky, Morgan eventually crossed into Indiana; he reached Salem on July 10, 1863, coming north from [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]]. Upon entering Salem at approximately 9 a.m., Morgan immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets. The cavalrymen burned the large, brick railroad depot, along with all the train cars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of the town. Morgan demanded taxes from the two [[flour mill]]s that belonged to DePauw and Knight, and from the Allen Wollen Mill. Morgan's men looted stores and took about $500 from the area before departing about 3 p.m.

Of the brief action at Salem, [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Basil W. Duke]], Morgan's second-in-command and brother-in-law, later said:

''&quot;They did not pillage with any sort of method or reason; it seemed to be a mania, senseless and purposeless. One man carried for two days a bird cage containing three [[canary|canaries]]. Another rode with a huge chafing dish on the pommel of his saddle. Although the weather was intensely warm, another slung seven pairs of [[skates]] around his neck. I saw very few articles of real value taken; they pillaged like boys robbing an [[orchard]].&quot;''

===Famous residents===
[[John Hay]], private secretary to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to Presidents [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was born in Salem and is generally known as Salem's most prominent citizen. A variety of museums and local buildings make reference to Mr. Hay's connections to the town.

Roy Robertson invented the process for making 2% [[milk]] while working at the Salem Creamery, where it was first produced and marketed. He was unable to obtain a patent and the invention was credited to someone else.

==Local Attractions==
Located in the center of Salem's town square, the Washington County Courthouse is generally known as Salem's most famous and recognizable landmark. The courthouse has historical placemarkers surrounding it, and at the southeastern corner of the grounds, there is a memorial to veterans killed in action during conflicts dating back to the [[Revolutionary War]].

[[Image:Salem, Indiana - Riley's Place 1.jpg|thumb|right|Riley's Place]]

Unusual for a town of this size is a large children's playground, &quot;Riley's Place&quot; at DePauw Park. Named after Riley Jean Tomlinson, a local toddler who accidentally drowned in a swimming pool, the park was built in 2001 and contains two- and three- story wooden castles and other structures for children's play (along with swings, slides, and similar playground equipment).

Every September, Salem celebrates &quot;Old Settler's Day&quot; at the [[John Hay Center]]. Set in a village of authentic log structures, the festival features historical re-enactments, as well as local arts and crafts.

Recently, Lake Salinda in Salem has been rumored to be home to the Salinda Serpent after reports were made about sightings of a giant snake in the lake. This information was reported by the Salem Leader in early June 2010.

Salem is also home to the legendary Salem Speedway. It is a half mile high banked paved oval that was first built in 1947. Many of the most legendary drivers of the past 50 years have raced there including Ted Horn, Parnelli Jones, AJ Foyt, Bobby and Al Unser, Mario Andretti, Larry Dickson, Darrell Waltrip and Jeff Gordon. AJ Foyt at one time held the world record for a half mile oval at the speedway. One of ESPN's first televised auto racing events was held there in 1979.

== Notable Information ==
Cambridge City was platted on October 23, 1836 and celebrated its [[Sesquicentennial]] in 1986.  The town celebrates its history and heritage during the second weekend in each September during the annual Canal Days festival, which commemorates the importance of the [[Whitewater Canal]] to the formation and growth of Cambridge City in the 19th century.  Situated along the historic [[National Road]] (U.S. 40), Cambridge City is currently a prominent destination for antique seekers and is the home of many notable American figures including:

*'''Justin Youngs'''- Local meat cutter famous for throwing bologna &amp; an OG.  
*'''Buckskin Ben''' - a famous show business personality of the 1890s
*'''Jason Bunger''' - Was a manager of the girls Tennis team (1996-1999) for three teams (1997-1999) who went to Semi State, the most of any team in Lincoln High School sports history. He is also a founding owner of www.fvsports.com, one of the premier sports sites on the web. Jason was also one of the most dominant Wiffle Ball players in the State of Indiana.
*&quot;'''Single G'''&quot; - a world famous pacer who won many horse races during the Great Depression
*'''[[Solomon Meredith]]''' - a [[Quaker]] general in the [[American Civil War]]
*'''The [[Overbeck Sisters]]''' - four daughters of John and Sarah Overpeck who hand-produced their internationally-known Overbeck Art Pottery in Cambridge City from 1911–1955, noted for their [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] designs, distinctive glazes and work in the grotesque style
*'''Huddleston Farmhouse''' - The [[Huddleston Farmhouse]] Inn &amp; Museum is located right outside Cambridge City in the small village of [[Mt. Auburn]] on the National Road.  It is the eastern regional office of [[Indiana Landmarks]] and the headquarters of the Indiana National Road Association.  Cambridge City is noted for its abundance in historic architecture, specifically in the Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles.  Famous structures include Rose Hill, the Conklin-Montgomery House, the Overbeck-Mattheis House, the Meredith-Rice House, the Bertsch House (home of the town's resident physician James Bertsch, D.O.), the Scheilder/Biser House, the Demwiddle-Mattingly House, the Martin Funk-Johnson House, the Fowler House, and many more.
*'''Vinton House''' - The Vinton House of Cambridge City is a former hotel that was established in 1847. This building sits at the former intersection of the National Road (U.S 40) and the Whitewater Canal. The canal's turnaround basin rested just a few feet from the Vinton House's rear door, which brought in passengers and goods from Cincinnati.

During the 1990s, members of Cambridge City's historic preservation group Western Wayne Heritage, Inc. purchased the famous Vinton House hotel.  Built in the 1840s to accommodate travelers on the newly opened Whitewater Canal and the National Road, Aaron Reisor opened the three-story hostelry on the Canal bank to run what at the time was one of Indiana's most opulent facilities.  Founded in 1984, Western Wayne Heritage, Inc. has been instrumental in promoting the history and culture of the Cambridge City area during the recent antique-history tourist boom of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

The Montgomery-Whitewater Chapter of the Indiana Junior Historical Society is located in Cambridge City and is sponsored by Lori Griffin, who was named by Mark Helmsing of the Indiana Council for History Education as an outstanding sponsor.

==History==

Centerville was platted in 1814 on land that once belonged to the [[Miami Indians]] and was settled by [[Quakers]] from Carolina and [[Virginia]]. A little known &quot;[[war]]&quot; was fought in [[Wayne County, Indiana]] in 1873 between Centerville and [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]]. The county seat was originally located in Centerville (Center Township). By 1870, Richmond (Wayne Township) had surpassed Centerville in business, population, and tax revenue. These factors led the population of Wayne Township to demand the county seat be moved to Richmond. The dispute was played out in the newspapers, courts, and petitions with Richmond the eventual winner.
A new courthouse was erected in Richmond and preparations were made to move records from Centerville to Richmond. Centerville stopped Richmond’s officials’ efforts to move the records twice. Once with locked gates with guards and the second by firing on their own courthouse with a three-pound [[cannon]] nicknamed “Black Betty.” The cannon was used when Richmond guards were brought in to protect the records. The cannon had been loaded with iron scraps. A crowd demanded the guard come out of the Centerville courthouse. When they refused, the cannon was fired, the door blown off its hinges, and the guards were forced to beat a hasty retreat&lt;ref&gt;Spahr, W. E. (1966). &quot;Center Township Library, Centerville, Indiana&quot;.&gt;[ http://www.waynet.org/waynet/spotlight/2001/011126-war.htm] Retrieved July 18, 2010, from Waynet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Soldiers were brought in the next day to move the records to Richmond. Centerville’s tenure as county seat had come to an end.
 
The holes from the cannon shot are still visible over the door of the old courthouse, now the Center Township Library.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 1828, the National Road, Main Street, was surveyed and later became the first improved section of the trail in 1850 by a Special Act of the [[U.S. Congress]].

Centerville's [[cobblestone]] [[street]] was a major stop along the trail to the West. During the height of the [[Gold Rush]], 49,000 wagons would travel along the street each year.

Centerville is known as the “City of Arches” due to the five main [[arches]] it has located on the Old National Road. The road used to be 100 feet wide, but was shortened to 65 feet due to the people of Centerville adding on to the front of the businesses and houses. The arches were used as a way to get behind the buildings and into the backyards of the houses&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Centerville, Indiana: The city of arches&quot;. (2008, March 10). [http://pwda.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/PWDA.woa/wa/page?id=7609&amp;name=areaCENTERVILLE] Retrieved July 16, 2010, from The Lantz House and Gathering Place Inn. &lt;/ref&gt;. The five arches that are located in Centerville are the Backenstoes Archway, Dill Archway, Shortridge Archway, Lantz Archway, and Malone Archway. They were all built between 1823 and 1836&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Centerville, Indiana&quot; . (2010).[http://www.waynet.org/community/centerville/default.htm].Retrieved July 16, 2010, from Waynet: Community Network Association.&lt;/ref&gt;.They are all located on [[National Road]] in Centerville. In August, Centerville has Archway Days, which is held in celebration and honor of the historical archways. They have food, games, and prizes, which attracts people from all over the state.
